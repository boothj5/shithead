Java version of shithead.

Still TODO:

Rules for end game
------------------

Number of cards in hand == 0 means start of end game for that player
Once the player is in end game
	either they must
		play from hand if hand > 0
		play from faceup if hand == 0 && faceup > 0
		play from facedown if hand == 0 && faceup == 0 and facedown > 0
